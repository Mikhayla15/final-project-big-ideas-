The dataset tracks the different crimes committed in different neighborhoods in Pittsburgh. It has crimes tracked from 2012-2023. There are tons of different crimes but for my metric, I looked at crimes involving arson. Blotter Data (UCR Coded) (data.wprdc.org) - https://data.wprdc.org/datastore/dump/044f2016-1dfd-4ab0-bc1e-065da05fca2e 
The data set shows the amount of non-traffic violations from different neighborhoods in Pittsburgh, more specifically the number of engaged in fighting violations. Non-Traffic Citations- https://data.wprdc.org/datastore/dump/6b11e87d-1216-463d-bbd3-37460e539d86
